## Software Development Lifecycle
* [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) - The process used to development and maintain software. There are several philosophies and methods that can be used, like Agile or Waterfall.
* [Scope Creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) / [Feature Creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) - When the initial scope or feature set for a product grows beyond the original intentions
* [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - A philosophy around SDLC that focuses on functionality and release speed over features
* [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) - A methodology that works well with Agile, focusing on speed of development, using constructs like Sprints and stand-up
* [Sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)) - A span of time (usually 1-3 weeks) used as a work unit in Scrum. When planning, sprints are dedicated to one or more features, where the feature is expected to be functional by the end of the sprint.
* [Stand-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)) - A short, daily meeting within a development team where members describe yesterday's progress, today's plans, and anything harming their progress. Its purpose is to increase transparency and allow members to help improve others' efficiency and remove blockers.
* Blocker - Anything that gets in the way of normal progress speed. Blockers could manifest as a lack of knowledge, dependency on another team, a long running process, or anything else causing a delay. Good planning identifies blockers early and plans to address them before they harm the timeline.
* [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) - A work philosophy (including SDLC) that prioritizes prior planning over adaptability. It is useful in settings where changes are costly, like manufacturing, but is generally frowned upon in settings where the cost of changes is low, as in software development. That is not to say that Waterfall is not useful in software, but it often carries a negative connotation.
